# Advance-DS-Algorithms-Implemented-in-Java
This repository contains tons of programs for various algorithms implemented in Java. Algorithms like euler tour, edmonds branching algorithm, bipartite matching algorithm. The main focus is on code quality, run time optimization, cleaner and high quality code which is easy to read. 


The repository contains projects in 2 categories

Short Projects
Long Projects

Short Projects as the name suggest are a bunch of small projects each of which can be done under 1 hour or so.
Long Projects are relatively big projects which have a lot of work done to them.
There are 1-3 levels in Long Projects. 

Level 1 is pretty easy, and was written in a day or 2.
Level 2 and three are some thoughtful levels, with some thinking required for them. 

The test cases are in the test case folder. Only the long projects have test cases.

These projects were done as part of the coursework for my course in "Implementation of Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms" at UT Dallas.

All long projects have reports along with them which discusses the run time of test cases and various problems encountered during the project.
